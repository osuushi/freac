# Selection measurements

Founder request, 2026-09-20: selecting faces/edges reports separation and geometric
relationships. Maximum means largest gap, not the farthest pair of points.

A compact lower-left readout automatically measures one or two selected solid faces,
solid edges, filled sketch regions in 3D, or whole curves in a sketch workspace.
Filled regions behave as bounded zero-thickness faces, preserving holes and world
placement. They measure against regions, solid faces and edges using the same gap,
angle and relationship rules. A single region shows its area. Hiding bodies does
not disable visible-region measurement. Point/group-handle selections are not whole
curves. Constraints and measurements share a vertical layout, constraints above
measurements; the stack scrolls when viewport height is limited. The card is hidden
during editing; accepted geometry is measured again after
acceptance or Undo. Camera changes only reproject witness lines. Results are transient,
not dimensions, constraints, saved annotations or history entries.

## Quantities and conventions

- One entity: exact kernel curve length or face area; radius/diameter for circular
  curves and cylindrical faces.
- Two entities: shortest distance between the actual trimmed shapes, independently
  of facing-region gap. Intersecting shapes have zero shortest distance.
- Gap corresponds to orthogonal nearest projection onto a supporting curve/surface,
  only where the projected point lies inside the selected trimmed entity. A lateral
  overhang cannot clamp to a boundary and inflate the gap. For like pairs both
  projection directions contribute, making the range independent of selection order.
  For edge/face pairs only edge-to-face projection contributes.
- Straight lines and polygonal planar faces use endpoints and the vertices of their
  projected overlap, including hole boundaries. The minimum also considers the
  exact bounded-shape minimum and plane crossings. These extrema are exact to kernel
  tolerance; this includes angled polygonal walls and partial overlaps.
- Parallel planes/lines, parallel line/plane pairs, concentric circular curves and
  coaxial cylindrical walls have constant analytic gaps when an overlap is found.
- Other curved pairs use 32 parameter intervals per boundary curve and a 16×16
  face-parameter grid, classified against exact trimming loops. These are explicitly
  approximate: sampled maximum is a lower bound and minimum may be high; small
  features or extrema may be missed. Circular/cylindrical correspondences that cross
  the selected source again are excluded, preventing remote back-side spans.
  Explanations live in the heading's (?) hover tooltip, rather than a paragraph
  in the readout; approximation marks remain beside values.
  This is not a certified clearance analysis. No resolved facing region shows
  unavailable gap, with shortest distance still available.
- Angles are the smaller unoriented supporting-line/plane angle (0–90 degrees),
  independent of the camera. Skew lines have no 2D angle. No single angle is assigned
  to general curved pairs. Parallel/perpendicular, coplanar/collinear, concentric
  circular and coaxial cylindrical relationships are shown when recognized.
- Center and axis distances are separate from gap. Distances use mm, areas mm²,
  angles degrees. Six significant display digits do not alter calculated values;
  numerical noise below 1e-7 displays as zero.

## Ownership and implementation

`measurement-input.ts` resolves stable IDs and current profile keys in the accepted
document. Region boundaries reuse extrusion's exact trimmed-face construction, solely
within the measurement query; no body or extrusion is stored. Shared sketch
curve construction feeds both projection and measurement. OCCT computes all results;
display triangles/polylines never determine the values. Queries use a separate owned
native calculator so background reads cannot cancel or mutate an editing candidate.
There is no additional document owner, acceptance path or Undo step. Errors from a
measurement do not change edit diagnostics or history.

The UI debounces selection, runs only one measurement query at once, and drops replies
whose selection/geometry no longer matches. It never installs the reply's model view.
Unchanged camera/hover updates do not serialize the BRep or rerun the kernel. The
readout and witness overlays dispose with the editor; the native process closes with
the document owner. Native calculation keeps its existing ten-second deadline.
